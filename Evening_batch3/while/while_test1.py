examples1:
    
a = 10

while a == 10:
    print("inside while loops")
    
#    
a = 10

while a > 10:
    print("inside while loops")   
    
print("out side while")    
    
#example3

a = 10

i = 1
while 20 > 10:
     
    i +=1
    print("inside while loops",i)  
    
    
print("out side while")

# print("Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] \
#       by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) \
#    in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language,\
#        which was inspired by SETL,[39] capable of exception handling \
#         and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.\
#        [10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[40]\
#         Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project,\
#     as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, \
#         when he announced his 'permanent vacation' \
#         from his responsibilities as Python's 'benevolent dictator for life', \
#         a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term \
#             commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[41] In January 2019,\
#                 active Python core developers elected a five-member\
#                     Steering Council to lead the project.[42][43]")
